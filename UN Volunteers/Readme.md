- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality", "column data type" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : There should not be any blank/empty dataset , null values & duplicate data.
