- Create a matrix to show region and subcategory wise sales and use conditional format to highlight lowest to highest sales in any colour of your choice
- Create a subcategory slicer to show interaction between the charts

**In analysis 2 page, create the following:**

- Create a gauge chart to show actual sales vs target sales which is 5 % increase from actual sales

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality", "column data type" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : There should not be any blank/empty dataset , null values & duplicate data.
